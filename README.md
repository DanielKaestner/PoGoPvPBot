## Usage

The bot has four core functions
- /trainername - Allows the user to set a trainername
- /pvp  - Create PvP-polls
- /iv   - Check the rank of a Pokémon for the great league according to [Go Stadium](https://gostadium.club/pvp/iv)
- ~~/rank - Check the [Silph Arena rank](hhttps://sil.ph/) of a player~~ - This will be reactivated once a public API by the TSA is released

### Trainernames
```/trainername``` can be used by players who's telegram username differs from their Pokemon Go username. After setting the trainername, the bot will mention the user with that name

### PvP-polls
With ```/pvp``` a user can create a PvP-poll. Other users can join and leave these polls by clicking the **fight** button below the PvP request. The creator of a poll can additionally customise the poll by providing additional information such as the league or specifying rules ```/pvp Great Mirror Cup```
If the creator of the poll has an open chat with the bot, it will send him a direct message which allows the creator to post the poll and return to the game immediately.

### IV checks
The bot can perform two types of IV-checks. The first one returns the optimal IV distribution for a Pokémon in the grat league which can be performed by ```/iv Shuckle```. 
A player can also check where a specific IV distribution ranks in the great league according to [Go Stadium](https://gostadium.club/pvp/iv). Such a request can be performed by specifying the IVs (A/D/S) ```/iv Shuckle 12 12 12```
To check the rank of alolan pokémon, ```+alolan``` must be appended to the pokémons name.

### ~~Silph Ranks~~
~~Users can retrieve the current [Silph Arena rank](hhttps://sil.ph/) of any player who's profile is not set to private. ```/rank``` followed by the player name returns the current rank of a player - E.g. ```/rank ValorAsh``` ~~
